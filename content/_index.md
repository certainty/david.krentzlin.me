üëã &nbsp; I'm David, a software engineer with two decades of experience specializing in backend development. I've worked with a wide range of languages and paradigms, from Lisp to Haskell, as well as Ruby, Scala, Elixir, and TypeScript. I'm continuously expanding my knowledge across different technologies.

My expertise lies in building distributed systems, scaling infrastructure, developing developer tools, and working with compilers. This field has been a source of long-term professional fulfillment for me.

I have experience leading teams and understand that successful projects are driven by the strength of the team.

Currently, I'm a Senior Architect at New Work SE, where I support the tech organization in transitioning the organization to the cloud.
