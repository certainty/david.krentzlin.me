Iâ€™m a software engineer with **management experience**, and I thrive in environments which require technical expertise as well as good communication and leadership.

In my **roughly 20 years as a software engineer**, I have worked on multiple high traffic, distributed services in all stages of their life-cycles, in multiple domains, and helped to scale them operationally and organizationally.

I care about good culture and try to increase my understanding of the environments, teams, systems, values, and practices that enable organizations to sustain in an industry, that is fast-paced and requires constant feedback and learning.
