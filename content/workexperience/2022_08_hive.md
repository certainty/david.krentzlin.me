As the tech lead in the delivery experience team, in a fast-growing startup, I worked closely with the product owner to shape upcoming features and help the team to deliver them. In my short time at Hive I invested most of my time in bringing the team up to speed with modern software development practices, identifying system boundaries and responsibilities as well as stabilizing 3rd party integrations.

- stabilize the client, that was used to communicate with 3rd party APIs. I optimized for success rate, resilience and observability 
- shape the development process together with the team to move from a reactive mode of working into a proactive one

**Leveraged skills**

Ruby on Rails, distributed systems, APIs, agile methods, project management, architectural guidance
