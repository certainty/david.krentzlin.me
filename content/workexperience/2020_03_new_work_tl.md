I lead a team of six software architects & software engineers in a newly created solution architecture area. 
As a platform team, we built and operate the central GraphQL API, which is used by 200+ engineers to build their products faster and more robust. 
As a former individual contributor in the team, I took on the leadership position and helped my engineers to be self-sustained, autonomous and achieve the teamâ€™s objectives.

- build the newly established team and foster good collaboration, team ownership and consistent delivery
- help to establish data-driven software delivery 
- and continuous improvement processes for consulting and platform projects 
- drive architectural decisions and give architectural guidance for the engineering organization
- enable my direct reports and support them in achieving their objectives and growing them in their functions 
- facilitate decision-making, group learning and continuous improvement to help the team take ownership of their platform 

**Leveraged skills**

leadership, management, communication, agile methods, coaching, project management, strategic decision-making,  architectural guidance
