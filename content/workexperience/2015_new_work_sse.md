##### XING One - GraphQL Gateway (2017 - 2020)

I was part of the core platform team that planned, designed, developed and rolled out the central GraphQL Gateway, which is called XING One. 
I accompanied the service through the early project phase, when it was scaled to the whole organization, and when it reached maturity.
The platform is now used by 200+ product engineers to build their products in a largely autonomous way.

- improved data handling for mobile and web clients by providing a faster, safer and more robust way to fetch data using GraphQL 
- planned and played an integral role in the development of bigger parts of the GraphQL service like file uploads, caching and logged-out support 
- increased availability, resilience, and performance of the GraphQL service through systematic measurement, profiling, monitoring and implementation of the required changes 
- built fast, secure, resilient and reliable HTTP level service-to-service communication 
- created and carried out workshops to train engineers in GraphQL and Scala 
- provided architectural guidance and support for product teams to learn how to leverage GraphQL the best for their domains 


**Leveraged skills**

Scala (AKKA, Finagle, Sangria), Ruby (Rails, Sinatra), GraphQL, distributed systems, RESTful APIs, caching, rate limiting, AMQP, MySQL, HTTP, network, concurrency, communication, lateral leadership
