##### Developer Experience and Automation (Jan 2024 - Present)

As part of the ongoing cloud migration, I changed my area of responsibility so that I can support the organization
best to move critical infrastructure into the cloud. In the developer experience and automation team I am a subject
matter expert for the API infrastructure that powers the data needs for all our applications.

This includes the synchronous data fetching layer via our GraphQL API federation layer as well as asynchronous service integration
with messaging infrastructure based on RabbitMQ / AmazonMQ.

My primary responsibility is to ensure seamless operation of our infrastructure, before during and after the migration of application
workloads to the cloud. This requires careful consideration, planning, coordination and execution to minimize disruption of product
development teams.
