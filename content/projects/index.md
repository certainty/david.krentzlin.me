I keep working on side projects, mostly to explore the topics I'm personally interested in.  Below you'll find the ones I consider noteworthy, either because I'm actively moving them forward or they showcase something interesting or entertaining. 

- [Braces - A scheme compiler and VM written in Rust](braces)
- [CL Braces - A compiler and VM built for introspection written in Common Lisp](cl_braces)
- [CL-DNS - Implement DNS in a weekend](implement_dns_in_a_weekend)
- [1BRC - Solve the one billion row challenge](one_billion_row_challenge)
