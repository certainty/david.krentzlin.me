# Projects

I keep working on side projects, mostly to explore the topics I'm personally interested in.  Below you'll find the ones I consider noteworthy, either because I'm actively moving them forward or they showcase something interesting or entertaining. 

- [[posts/cl\_braces.md | CL-Braces - A compiler and VM built for introspection written in Common Lisp]]
- [[posts/braces.md | Braces - A scheme compiler and VM written in Rust]]
- [[posts/implement\_dns\_in\_a\_weekend.md | CL-DNS - Implement DNS in a weekend]]
- [[posts/one\_billion\_row\_challenge.md | 1brc - Solve the one billion row challenge]]
